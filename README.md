--- Download assets

## Step One

 -Upon launch the homepage should display to allow customers to navigate through the available products

 --First Page (Home Page)

 -Customers without login credentials should be redirected to the login page when they try to place an order.

 --Second page (Login Page)

 -User login page should provide an option to login or create an accounts.

 -User data should be validated to ensure valid data is submitted. Hint(use controlled components)

## Step Two

 -After logging in, Users should be able to purchase products.

  Fourth Page (details page ==> checkout page)

### Step three

 -To persist user data, the data should be store in a local storage which serve as demo database.

 -The cart data should also be store in local storage.

#### Hint

- Hooks to look for

   useState (To manage local state),

   useEffect (Handle Side effects),

   useContext (To manage global state)

   useReducer (combine useContext and useReducer to manage your global state)

- Routing is required (npm install react-router-dom)
